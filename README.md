Intrusion_detection_system
The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a crucial component of network security, designed to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.
The purpose of this project was to develop a comprehensive IDS system using Python, machine learning algorithms, and a web-based user interface, aimed at enhancing the customer's cybersecurity posture.
The project had multiple objectives, including the development of a network-based IDS system, implementation of machine learning algorithms for detecting security threats, and designing a web-based user interface. The team used Python programming language, Docker for containerization, HTML, CSS, and JS for developing the user interface.
The project team aimed to create a reliable and effective IDS system that could accurately detect security threats while reducing false positives. Additionally, they aimed to develop a user-friendly interface to enable users to view security alerts and take quick action when necessary.
